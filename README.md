## General Information

Pinido is a todo app to learn more about concepts like Vue3, Vite, Firebase, Pinia, Vue Router and Tailwind.

I tried to use latest versions of the technologies to stay up to date with them.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue3 (with typescript)**
  - Pinia as a state manager
  - Tailwindcss as a css framework
  - Firebase to handle db, auth and image uploading.
  - Vue router to achieve route management across app
- **Firebase**
  - Firebase storage
  - Firebase firestore
  - Firebase auth (email/password authentication)

## Setup

First, clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/berkaycimsir/pinido.git <directory_name>`

Second, go to the project folder and install dependencies:

`yarn install`

Then, set your environment variables:

> This project uses firebase as database. You can read more about firebase from [here](https://firebase.google.com/)

```ts
// .env

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY =
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN =
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID =
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET =
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID =
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID =
```

Finally, you can start the project by running:

`yarn dev`
